# Collection of Power Apps Custom Components (PCF)

Power Apps offers a no-code to low-code environment which is great to stand up an internal app very quickly.

Eventually there will be a need for customization that will require development using custom API endpoints, connectors and lastly custom components.

PCF or the Power Apps Component Framework allows a large amount of customization in terms of building custom components.

Examples of these are on device QR code generators, localization toolsets and so on.

This repository aims to be a collection point of components that I've built to enable making apps for the Power Platform simpler.
